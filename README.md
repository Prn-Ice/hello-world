# hello-world

Just continuing on the hello world tradition here.

Ladies and gentle-men my name is storm and I am the laziest person I know but I am working on that cause I have to.
I truly enjoy programming and I do see myself doing it for the rest of my life.
I hope to educate others on the benefits of the linx OS and of being a programmer.
I also hope to one day be good enough to be the standard for programmers worldwide.
Sorry for the child-like writing but I was told to write a little about myself and this is all i could come up with.
